# KotlinTodoApp
Project created as a kind of first lesson of learning kotlin.

Application is created for android. It's just simple todo application made for learning purpose. First project, where I try to do few things by myself instead of going through tutorials etc.

# Features
- Creating todo items
- Editing todo items (long touch on selected item)
- Delete todo item
- Dark theme
- Nice UI design

# Roadmap
- Store items in local db
- Maybe change workflow from simple editing and creating to dialogs and separate activities as pages
